# Trackify
 Trackify is a Flask web application that allows users to view their top tracks on Spotify over different time periods. Users can authenticate with their Spotify account and see a customized receipt-style display of their most listened-to tracks for short-term, medium-term, and long-term periods. Each track's name is clickable, linking directly to its Spotify page.
